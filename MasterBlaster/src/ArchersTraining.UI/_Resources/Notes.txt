-update verbiage on "http://localhost:64650/Account/Register" page to be less annoying and demo-ish
-consider changing 2-click register-confirm-then-login to a 1-click process.
-stopgap until stored procedure setup to make userdetails record going with brand new registered user account 
	-- just send email to admin to review and do it manually



-when archer goes to LessonsByCourse, consider highlight/checking/greying out the "completed lessons"

done-
-review lockdown so archers can access courses page
-review if new users are being auto-assigned role of archer
-hide all nav for links to places current user isn't authorized to go to
-add metadata for displayname for registermodel FN/LN
-put some way of knowing and who is logged in
-give way to log out.
-provide a login/register link - new users need place to start
